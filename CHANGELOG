KDE 4.1
==========================

New Features:
	- Text anti-aliasing can be turned off via the 'Smooth Fonts' option in the profile editor
	- Make mouse-wheel scrolling work in "less" and other terminal applications which don't
	understand mouse commands.
	- BUG 158235 - Support Xterm's clear history escape sequence 
	- BUG 157256 - The session number can be displayed in tab titles using the %# marker
	- Added option to specify whether new sessions start in the same directory as the current
	session.

Minor changes:
	- Limit tab name length to prevent a single tab from taking up the entire tab bar.

Fixes:
	- Fix embedded terminal not gaining focus when shown in Dolphin
	- Update scrolling optimisations to work with Qt 4.4

	- BUG 155801 - 	Support for setting background and foreground colors of the current session 
					using the xtermcontrol tool

					Xterm compatibility

					cannot be started (eg. because the program is missing).  Try to fall back

					to Qt 4.4
	- BUG 159096 -  'Find Next'/'Find Previous' jumped to the wrong line number if the output
